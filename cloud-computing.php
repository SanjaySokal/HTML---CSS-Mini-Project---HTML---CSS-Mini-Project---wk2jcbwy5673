                            One of the biggest business benefits of centrally managing print from the cloud is a dramatically simplified print infrastructure. Traditional on-premise-based print infrastructures in organizations with multiple branches or offices, can be particularly complex to manage. Each physical location requires a dedicated print server and as a business grows, adds to its fleet or opens new offices; that typically requires further investment in print servers and more time pressures on IT.
